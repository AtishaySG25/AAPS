>The non-significant p-value suggests that there is not enough evidence to conclude that the "underweight" category has a linear relationship with disease progression.

>Based on the coefficient values the disease progression is significantly worse in unhealthy people compared to healthy ones.

>The difference in coefficients of unhealthy people compared to the overweight ones indicates that disease progression is significantly worse in unhealthy people compared to overweight ones.

>For "healthy" individuals:
Disease Progression=109.376
For "overweight" individuals:
Disease Progression=109.376+55.656

Disease Progression=109.376âˆ’10.376

>BMILEVEL, S1, S5, and S6 have small p-values, suggesting that they are statistically significant predictors of disease progression.

>S2, S3, S4 have p-values above 0.05, indicating that their relationship with disease progression is not statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level.

>Both models seem to be quite similar in terms of accuracy. The simpler model with BMILEVEL, S1, S5, and S6 might be preferable if it gives a comparable fit.

There is significant change in the accuracy for a linear model without interaction between BMI and Gender
